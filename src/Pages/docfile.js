      The global burden of neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions is
      high, with approximately 70% of the burden in low- and middle-income
      countries. Neurological conditions are the leading cause of disability
      adjusted life years (DALYs) and the second leading cause of death
      globally, accounting for 9 million deaths per year. The four largest
      contributors of neurological DALYs in 2016 were stroke (42.2%) migraine
      (16.3%) dementia (10.4%) and meningitis (7.9%). Epilepsy (5%) ranked
      fifth. Parkinsonâ€™s disease, propelled by an increasingly large ageing
      population, is the fastest growing neurological disorder. Notably, in
      Southeast East Asia and Africa, the burden of neurological conditions in
      children remains particularly large due to premature birth, neonatal
      encephalopathy and neuroinfections. Developmental disabilities accounted
      for 13.3% of the 29.3 million YLDs for all health conditions among
      children younger than 5 years in 2016. Despite the large burden posed by
      brain health conditions only 28% of low-income countries having a
      dedicated policy for neurological diseases in comparison with 64% of
      high-income countries. Available resources for these conditions are
      insufficient in most countries and the treatment gap for many neurological
      and neurodevelopmental conditions is unacceptably high. For example, in
      low- and middle-income countries, there are only three adult neurologists
      per 10 million people. In contrast, there are 4.75 adult neurologists per
      100,000 people in high-income countries. There are even fewer resources
      for the assessment and care of children with neurological and
      neurodevelopmental conditions.
